The cleantable dataset is a tidy dataset consisting of averages of each variable in the original UCI HAR dataset which contained 'mean()' or 'std()'. It's dimensions are 180 X 68

The first two columns describe the subject and the activity. The remaining 66 variables are the means of the features described below.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 

This variable describes the subject performing the activity. There are 10 subjects in the dataset

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activity: 

This is the action being performed by each subject. There are 6 activities:

* Laying
* Sitting
* Standing
* Walking_Downstairs
* Walking_Upstairs

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To describe the 66 features, the following description has been taken from the README provided with the UCI HAR dataset and modified to explain my cleantable dataset.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

For each record it is provided:
------------------------------------------

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (Acc)(total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. atu
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope (Gyro).
- A 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### The dataset includes the following measurements:
---------------------------------------------

The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the Y and Z axis.

bodyAcc indicates the body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

bodyGyro indicates: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

### Feature Selection
----------------------------------

* The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer (Acc) and gyroscope (Gyro) 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 

* Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 

* Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

## Units and Variable descriptions

* mean() indicates the mean value
* std() indicates the standard deviation
* Accelerometer measurements containing (Acc) are measured in standard gravity units g
* Gyroscope measurements containing (Gyro) are measured in radians/second
* 'jerk' Indicates a jerk signal , that is the signal was derived in time
* Standard deviations and means are expressed in the same units
